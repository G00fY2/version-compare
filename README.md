=====
Lightweight Android & Java library to compare version strings.

This library allows you to easily compare version strings. Versions can but do not necessarily have to follow the SemVer convention. Any number of version parts as well as common pre-release suffixes will be taken into account.

Pure Java (java.util), no dependencies, very small method count.

## Usage
Include the library in your `build.gradle`
```
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.g00fy2:versioncompare:1.2.8'
}
```
**Note**: This will download the recommended Android *AAR* artifact with Android specific data like ProGuard rules. If you need a traditional *JAR* artifact add `@jar` to the library version.

To compare two version strings just create a new Version object. Invalid inputs (*null* or non-numeric first char) will by default be handled as `0.0.0`.
```java
boolean result;

result = new Version("1.2.1").isHigherThan("1.2"); // result = true

result = new Version("1.0.2-rc2").isLowerThan("1.0.2-rc3"); // result = true

result = new Version("1.3").isEqual("1.3.0"); // result = true

result = new Version("1.8.0-rc").isHigherThan("1.8"); // result = false
result = new Version("1.8.0-rc").isAtLeast("1.8"); // result = true
```

### For more detailed usage, check out the [documentation](https://g00fy2.github.io/version-compare/com/g00fy2/versioncompare/Version.html).

## Version structure example
```
Version 1.7.3-rc2.xyz
            +-------+   +-------+   +-------+   +-------+
    String  |   1   | . |   7   | . | 3-rc2 | . |  xyz  |
            +-------+   +-------+   +-------+   +-------+
                |           |         |  |          |
  major  [1] <--            |         |   ----      |
  minor  [7] <--------------          |       | ----
  patch  [3] <------------------------        ||
         ...                            +------------+
                                suffix  |  -rc2.xyz  |
                                        +------------+
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
suffix compare logic                          ||
                                         -----  -----
                                        |            |
                                    +-------+    +-------+
              detected pre-release  |  rc2  |    | .xyz  |  ignored part
                                    +-------+    +-------+
                                       ||
                                    ---  ---
                                   |        |
                                +----+    +---+
                                | rc |    | 2 |  pre-release build
                                +----+    +---+
```

**Notes:**
* expected separator between version numbers is `.`
* the optional suffix does **not need** a special separator

### Supported pre-release suffixes
| order | suffix     |
| ----- | --------- |
| 4     | *empty* or *unknown* |
| 3     | rc        |
| 2     | beta      |
| 1     | alpha     |
| 0     | pre + alpha |

**Notes:**
* higher order results in higher version `1.0 > 1.0-beta`
* pre-release builds are supported `1.0-rc3 > 1.0-rc2`
